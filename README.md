#Website A/B Test Analysis

A/B Test

Welcome to the "Website A/B Test Analysis" repository! This project focuses on a comprehensive data analysis to compare the performance of two website versions: the old one and the new one. The primary objective is to help the company make an informed decision on which version to adopt for future use, backed by robust data-driven insights.

Project Overview:

In this analysis, we employ three key approaches:

Probability Theory: We assess the likelihood of observed differences in key metrics between the two website versions being due to random chance, using p-values and confidence intervals.

A/B Test Techniques: The A/B test plays a crucial role in comparing the old and new website versions under controlled conditions. Hypothesis testing ensures a rigorous evaluation, and we directly measure the impact on user behavior and conversions.

Regression Approach: Utilizing logistic regression analysis, we explore the relationships between dependent variables (e.g., click-through rates, conversion rates). Additionally, we assess the variance inflation factor (VIF) to ensure reliable results. This helps identify significant design elements contributing to the overall website performance.
